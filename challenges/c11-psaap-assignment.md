*Purpose*: Confidence and prediction intervals are useful for studying
“pure sampling” of some distribution. However, we can combine CI and PI
with regression analysis to equip our modeling efforts with powerful
notions of uncertainty. In this challenge, you will use fluid simulation
data in a regression analysis with uncertainty quantification (CI and
PI) to support engineering design.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|----|----|----|
| Effort | Some task **q**’s left unattempted | All task **q**’s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase “more data are necessary” without clarification | Any statement that “more data are necessary” specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

# Orientation: Exploring Simulation Results

*Background*: The data you will study in this exercise come from a
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) [simulation
campaign](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301932219308651?via%3Dihub)
that studied the interaction of turbulent flow and radiative heat
transfer to fluid-suspended particles\[1\]. These simulations were
carried out to help study a novel design of [solar
receiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_solar_power),
though they are more aimed at fundamental physics than detailed device
design. The following code chunk downloads and unpacks the data to your
local `./data/` folder.

![PSAAP II irradiated core flow](./images/psaap-setup.png) Figure 1. An
example simulation, frozen at a specific point in time. An initial
simulation is run (HIT SECTION) to generate a turbulent flow with
particles, and that swirling flow is released into a rectangular domain
(RADIATED SECTION) with bulk downstream flow (left to right).
Concentrated solar radiation transmits through the optically transparent
fluid, but deposits heat into the particles. The particles then convect
heat into the fluid, which heats up the flow. The false-color image
shows the fluid temperature: Notice that there are “hot spots” where hot
particles have deposited heat into the fluid. The dataset `df_psaap`
gives measurements of `T_norm = (T - T0) / T0` averaged across planes at
various locations along the RADIATED SECTION.

**Observations**:

- This dataset has a lot of variables!
- The range and order of magnitude of the variables varies greatly. Some
  are on the order of a microunit, some on a gigaunit, while others
  float around one.
  - Most variables stay within the same order of magnitude between their
    min and max values.
- idx is the index; this suggests there are 35 runs of the same data
  collection/simulation.

The important variables in this dataset are:

| Variable | Category | Meaning                           |
|----------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| `x`      | Spatial  | Channel location                  |
| `idx`    | Metadata | Simulation run                    |
| `L`      | Input    | Channel length                    |
| `W`      | Input    | Channel width                     |
| `U_0`    | Input    | Bulk velocity                     |
| `N_p`    | Input    | Number of particles               |
| `k_f`    | Input    | Turbulence level                  |
| `T_f`    | Input    | Fluid inlet temp                  |
| `rho_f`  | Input    | Fluid density                     |
| `mu_f`   | Input    | Fluid viscosity                   |
| `lam_f`  | Input    | Fluid conductivity                |
| `C_fp`   | Input    | Fluid isobaric heat capacity      |
| `rho_p`  | Input    | Particle density                  |
| `d_p`    | Input    | Particle diameter                 |
| `C_pv`   | Input    | Particle isochoric heat capacity  |
| `h`      | Input    | Convection coefficient            |
| `I_0`    | Input    | Radiation intensity               |
| `eps_p`  | Input    | Radiation absorption coefficient  |
| `avg_q`  | Output   | Plane-averaged heat flux          |
| `avg_T`  | Output   | Plane-averaged fluid temperature  |
| `rms_T`  | Output   | Plane-rms fluid temperature       |
| `T_norm` | Output   | Normalized fluid temperature rise |

The primary output of interest is `T_norm = (avg_T - T_f) / T_f`, the
normalized (dimensionless) temperature rise of the fluid, due to heat
transfer. These measurements are taken at locations `x` along a column
of fluid, for different experimental settings (e.g. different dimensions
`W, L`, different flow speeds `U_0`, etc.).

### **q2** Visualize `T_norm` against `x`. Note that there are multiple simulations at different values of the Input variables: Each simulation result is identified by a different value of `idx`.

``` r
## TODO: Visualize the data in df_psaap with T_norm against x;
##       design your visual to handle the multiple simulations,
##       each identified by different values of idx
df_psaap %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x, T_norm, group = idx, color = idx)) +
  geom_line()
```

![](c11-psaap-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q2-task-1.png)<!-- -->

This visualization doesn’t do a good job differentiating between the
different run indexes with the color scale. However, identifying the
specific line associated with a specific index iteration isn’t relevant
to this visualization.

## Modeling

The following chunk will split the data into training and validation
sets.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
# Addl' Note: These data are already randomized by idx; no need
# to additionally shuffle the data!
df_train <- df_psaap %>% filter(idx %in% 1:20)
df_validate <- df_psaap %>% filter(idx %in% 21:36)
```

One of the key decisions we must make in modeling is choosing predictors
(features) from our observations to include in the model. Ideally we
should have some intuition for why these predictors are reasonable to
include in the model; for instance, we saw above that location along the
flow `x` tends to affect the temperature rise `T_norm`. This is because
fluid downstream has been exposed to solar radiation for longer, and
thus is likely to be at a higher temperature.

Reasoning about our variables—at least at a *high level*—can help us to
avoid including *fallacious* predictors in our models. You’ll explore
this idea in the next task.

### **q3** The following code chunk fits a few different models. Compute a measure of model accuracy for each model on `df_validate`, and compare their performance.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit these models
fit_baseline <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ x)

fit_cheat <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ avg_T)

fit_nonphysical <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ idx)

## TODO: Compute a measure of accuracy for each fit above;
##       compare their relative performance
mse(fit_baseline, df_validate)
```

    ## [1] 0.08092764

``` r
rsquare(fit_baseline, df_validate)
```

    ## [1] 0.4746546

``` r
mse(fit_cheat, df_validate)
```

    ## [1] 0.05371774

``` r
rsquare(fit_cheat, df_validate)
```

    ## [1] 0.6374051

``` r
mse(fit_nonphysical, df_validate)
```

    ## [1] 0.1590517

``` r
rsquare(fit_nonphysical, df_validate)
```

    ## [1] 0.001898415

**Observations**:

- Which model is *most accurate*? Which is *least accurate*?
  - The `fit_cheat` to `x` is most accurate, while the `fit_baseline`to
    `avg_T` falls somewhere in the middle, and the `fit_nonphysical` to
    `idx` is not accurate at all.
- What *Category* of variable is `avg_T`? Why is it such an effective
  predictor?
  - `avg_T` is also an output variable. As such, of course it is going
    to behave the same way as the other output variables, but this
    doesn’t tell us anything about how our input variables (the ones we
    can actually control) actually impact and control the output. It can
    effectively predict `T_norm`, but this because `T_norm` is computed
    in terms of `avg_T` after the other input variables have be used to
    approximate (or actually real-world influence) `avg_T`.
- Would we have access to `avg_T` if we were trying to predict a *new*
  value of `T_norm`? Is `avg_T` a valid predictor?
  - No, as `avg_T` is an output. New predictions must be made based upon
    the input variables that actually cause the output to vary.
- What *Category* of variable is `idx`? Does it have any physical
  meaning?
  - `idx` is simulation metadata; it enumerates each independant run of
    the simulation. It doesn’t have any physical meaning and is
    unrelated to any of the input variables or output variables (unless,
    by chance, `idx` increases linearly with time and there was a
    consistent change in operating conditions not taken into account
    with other inputs).

### **q4** Interpret this model

Interpret the following model by answering the questions below.

*Note*. The `-` syntax in R formulas allows us to exclude columns from
fitting. So `T_norm ~ . - x` would fit on all columns *except* `x`.

``` r
## TODO: Inspect the regression coefficients for the following model
fit_q4 <- 
  df_train %>% 
   lm(formula = T_norm ~ . - idx - avg_q - avg_T - rms_T)
  # lm(formula = T_norm ~ L + W + U_0 + N_p + k_f + T_f)
  # lm(formula = T_norm ~ L - W - U_0 - N_p - k_f - T_f)

df_train %>% 
  summarise(
    sd_x = sd(x),
    sd_tf = sd(T_f)
  )
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 2
    ##    sd_x sd_tf
    ##   <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 0.281  39.8

``` r
fit_q4 %>% 
  tidy() %>%

**Observations**:

- Which columns are excluded in the model formula above? What categories
  do these belong to? Why are these important quantities to leave out of
  the model?
  - The first (commented out) model only excludes the nonphysical
    quantities (ie `idx`) and the output quantities (`avg_q`, `avg_T`,
    and `rms_T`). These are important to exclude because they don’t
    actually play any bearing on the inputs and determining the outcome
    of the model (in the latter case, they are the outcome).
  - The second (and only uncommented) model excludes the spatial
    quantities (channel location, `x`) alongside the constant physical
    properties of the fluid and particles (density, viscosity, etc.). It
    is possible that these quantities do not change test-to-test and are
    are thus not particularly feasible to change and consider as inputs
    when optimizing or changing the system.
- Which inputs are *statistically significant*, according to the model?
  - None of the physical properties that are excluded in the second
    model appear to be statistically significant.
  - The spatial position, `x`, is the most statistically significant
    variable, as discussed above.
  - Based on a p-value threshold of 0.05, in order of decreasing
    significance, other significant variables are:
    - `W`, the channel width
    - `L`, the channel length
    - `I_0`, the radiation intensity
    - `U_0`, the bulk velocity
    - `d_p`, the particle diameter
    - `N_p`, the number of particles, and `C_fp`, the particle isochoric
      heat capacity, are both just outside the edge of being
      significant.
- What is the regression coefficient for `x`? What about the regression
  coefficient for `T_f`?
  - The regression coefficient for `x` is about 1, while the regression
    coefficient for `T_f` is much smaller at -3.8e-4.
- What is the standard deviation of `x` in `df_psaap`? What about the
  standard deviation of `T_f`?
  - The standard deviation of `x` in `df_psaap` is 0.28, while the
    standard deviation of `T_f` is much larger at 39.81.
- How do these standard deviations relate to the regression coefficients
  for `x` and `T_f`?
  - Yes. In this case and small sample size of two, smaller standard
    deviations relation to larger regression coefficients.
- Note that literally *all* of the inputs above have *some* effect on
  the output `T_norm`; so they are all “significant” in that sense. What
  does this tell us about the limitations of statistical significance
  for interpreting regression coefficients?
  - To some extent, the p-value used to determine what is and isn’t
    statistically significant is somewhat arbitrary. While we can be
    reasonably confident about this correlation in larger and more
    complete datasets, this value can “prove” correlation without
    necessarily proving causation. As such, there are limits in this
    calculation to differentiating what is actually correlated and what
    is random variation between iterations that can appear as
    correlation. In other words, the validity is limited by the
    completeness and accuracy of the training dataset, any random error
    that may be present in it, and whether it scales to represent the
    system being studied at large.

## Contrasting CI and PI

Let’s revisit the ideas of confidence intervals (CI) and prediction
intervals (PI). Let’s fit a very simple model to these data, one which
only considers the channel location and ignores all other inputs. We’ll
also use the helper function `add_uncertainties()` (defined in the
`setup` chunk above) to add approximate CI and PI to the linear model.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
fit_simple <-
  df_train %>%
  lm(data = ., formula = T_norm ~ x)

df_intervals <-
  df_train %>%
  add_uncertainties(fit_simple, interval = "confidence", prefix = "ci") %>%
  add_uncertainties(fit_simple, interval = "prediction", prefix = "pi")
```

The following figure visualizes the regression CI and PI against the
objects they are attempting to capture:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
df_intervals %>%
  select(T_norm, x, matches("ci|pi")) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = c("method", ".value"),
    names_sep = "_",
    cols = matches("ci|pi")
  ) %>%

  ggplot(aes(x, fit)) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr, color = method),
    width = 0.05,
    size = 1
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    data = df_psaap %>% mutate(method = "ci"),
    mapping = aes(x, T_norm),
    se = FALSE,
    linetype = 2,
    color = "black"
   ) +
  geom_point(
    data = df_validate %>% mutate(method = "pi"),
    mapping = aes(x, T_norm),

  ) +

  facet_grid(~method) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Channel Location (-)",
    y = "Normalized Temperature Rise (-)"
  )
```

Under the `ci` facet we have the regression confidence intervals and the
mean trend (computed with all the data `df_psaap`). Under the `pi` facet
we have the regression prediction intervals and the `df_validation`
observations.

**Punchline**:

- Confidence intervals are meant to capture the *mean trend*
- Prediction intervals are meant to capture *new observations*

Both CI and PI are a quantification of the uncertainty in our model, but
the two intervals designed to answer different questions.

Since CI and PI are a quantification of uncertainty, they should tend to
*narrow* as our model becomes more confident in its predictions.
Building a more accurate model will often lead to a reduction in
uncertainty. We’ll see this phenomenon in action with the following
task:

### **q5** The following code will construct a predicted-vs-actual plot with your model from *q4* and add prediction intervals. Study the results and answer the questions below under *observations*.

``` r
## TODO: Run this code and interpret the results
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
## NOTE: This chunk will use your model from q4; it will predict on the
##       validation data, add prediction intervals for every prediction,
##       and visualize the results on a predicted-vs-actual plot. It will
##       also compare against the simple `fit_simple` defined above.

  )
```

![](c11-psaap-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Which model tends to be more accurate? How can you tell from this
  predicted-vs-actual plot?
  - The q4 model tends to be more accurate. The overall distances
    between the dot-values and the trend line are much closer together
    compared to those of the x only plot.
- Which model tends to be *more confident* in its predictions? Put
  differently, which model has *narrower prediction intervals*?
  - The q4 model is again more confident in its predictions. The length
    of each line representing the width of the prediction interval is
    much narrower than that of the x only plot while still encompassing
    the trend line.
- How many predictors does the `fit_simple` model need in order to make
  a prediction? What about your model `fit_q4`?
  - The fit_simple model needs only a single value - x - to make a
    prediction. This compares to the model used in q4 which uses all 17
    predictors to make a prediction. While the q4 model is more accurate
    and confident, it requires a significantly higher input in order to
    make that determination.

Based on these results, you might be tempted to always throw every
reasonable variable into the model. For some cases, that might be the
best choice. However, some variables might be *outside our control*; for
example, variables involving human behavior cannot be fully under our
control. Other variables may be *too difficult to measure*; for example,
it is *in theory* possible to predict the strength of a component by
having detailed knowledge of its microstructure. However, it is
*patently infeasible* to do a detailed study of *every single component*
that gets used in an airplane.

In both cases—human behavior and variable material properties—we would
be better off treating those quantities as random variables. There are
at least two ways we could treat these factors: 1. Explicitly model some
inputs as random variables and construct a model that *propagates* that
uncertainty from inputs to outputs, or 2. Implicitly model the
uncontrolled the uncontrolled variables by not including them as
predictors in the model, and instead relying on the error term
$\epsilon$ to represent these unaccounted factors. You will pursue
strategy 2. in the following Case Study.

# Case Study: Predicting Performance Ranges

### **q6** You are consulting with a team that is designing a prototype heat transfer device. They are asking you to help determine a *dependable range of values* for `T_norm` they can design around for this *single prototype*. The realized value of `T_norm` must not be too high as it may damage the downstream equipment, but it must also be high enough to extract an acceptable amount of heat.

In order to maximize the conditions under which this device can operate
successfully, the design team has chosen to fix the variables listed in
the table below, and consider the other variables to fluctuate according
to the values observed in `df_psaap`.

| Variable | Value    |
|----------|----------|
| `x`      | 1.0      |
| `L`      | 0.2      |
| `W`      | 0.04     |
| `U_0`    | 1.0      |
| (Other)  | (Varies) |

Your task is to use a regression analysis to deliver to the design team
a *dependable range* of values for `T_norm`, given their proposed
design, and at a fairly high level `0.8`. Perform your analysis below
(use the helper function `add_uncertainties()` with the `level`
argument!), and answer the questions below.

*Hint*: This problem will require you to *build a model* by choosing the
appropriate variables to include in the analysis. Think about *which
variables the design team can control*, and *which variables they have
chosen to allow to vary*. You will also need to choose between computing
a CI or PI for the design prediction.

``` r
# NOTE: No need to change df_design; this is the target the client
#       is considering
df_design <- tibble(x = 1, L = 0.2, W = 0.04, U_0 = 1.0)
# NOTE: This is the level the "probability" level customer wants
pr_level <- 0.8

## TODO: Fit a model, assess the uncertainty in your prediction, 
#        use the validation data to check your uncertainty estimates, and 
#        make a recommendation on a *dependable range* of values for T_norm
#        at the point `df_design`
fit_q6 <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ x + L + W + U_0)

df_uncert <-
  df_validate %>% 
  add_uncertainties(
    fit_q6,
    interval = "prediction",
    prefix = "pi",
    level = pr_level
  )


df_uncert %>% 
  mutate(in_range = (T_norm > pi_lwr & T_norm < pi_upr)) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_in_range = mean(in_range),
    mean_lwr = mean(pi_lwr),
    mean_upr = mean(pi_upr)
    )
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 3
    ##   mean_in_range mean_lwr mean_upr
    ##           <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>
    ## 1         0.933    0.364     1.13

**Recommendation**:

- How much do you trust your model? Why?
  - Overall, I am decently confident in this model given the relatively
    small amount of training data provided. 93% of values are within the
    prediction interval of 80% that was specified in the design
    specifications.
- What kind of interval—confidence or prediction—would you use for this
  task, and why?
  - I used a prediction interval since we are trying to predict a range
    of future observations rather than reflecting a sample on a
    population.
- What fraction of validation cases lie within the intervals you
  predict? (NB. Make sure to calculate your intervals *based on the
  validation data*; don’t just use one single interval!) How does this
  compare with `pr_level`?
  - The percentage of validation cases that lie within the interval is
    93.3%. This is higher than the required level of 80% in `pr_level`.
- What interval for `T_norm` would you recommend the design team to plan
  around?
  - Taking a mean of the upper and lower prediction interval ranges
    suggests a good range for `T_norm` to plan around would be between
    0.364 and 1.135.
- Are there any other recommendations you would provide?
  - If the design team wanted to further increase the accuracy of the
    model, they could fix more of the variables identified as
    statistically significant in q4 such as I_0, N_p, and d_p

*Bonus*: One way you could take this analysis further is to recommend
which other variables the design team should tightly control. You could
do this by fixing values in `df_design` and adding them to the model. An
exercise you could carry out would be to systematically test the
variables to see which ones the design team should more tightly control.
